This repository stores the complementary material of the article enttitled Bayesian Inference for Multivariate Spatial Models with INLA by Francisco Palmí Perales, Virgilio Gómez Rubio, Roger S Bivand, Michela Cameletti and Havard Rue.

Specifically, you will find four archives: 

  1. Mult-geos.R --> In this file you will find the code for the geostatistical example of the article. 
  2. Mult-lattie.R --> In this file you will find the code for the lattice data example of the article. 
  3. Mult-ppp.R --> In this file you will find the code for the point patterns example of the article. 
  4. dismap_sim_data.RData --> The data needed to reproduce the multivariate lattice example. 
  5. utils.R --> In this file you will finde an extra function used in some of the other scripts. 
  6. README.txt --> The archive you are reading. 

  Thanks for reading.
